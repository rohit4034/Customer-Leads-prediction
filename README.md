# Customer-Leads-prediction
Here we have a dataset of leads with their set of features and their status. I have  built a ML model that predicts the lead score as an OUTPUT on the basis of the INPUT set of features. This lead score will range from 0-100, so more the lead score means more chances of conversion of lead to WON.
